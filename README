CSE 143: Natural Language Processing
Assignment 1

To run my program, first open it in pycharm. Make sure the train, dev, and test data sets are in the same directory.
Click add configuration, click the plus icon, click python, and give it a name (for example, nlp_models).
Then click the folder icon under script path which should default to where the file is, then press ok. Then choose a
python interpreter. Then press apply at the bottom and press ok.

Then the program will be ready to run, so press the play button to run models.py. This will first print the perplexities of the unigram, bigram, and trigram
models for each data set. Then, it will print the linear interpolated smoothed perplexity for each data set using the
best hyperparameters I found during my grid search on the dev set.

If you want to try different hyperparameters, change the values of x1, x2, or x3 on lines 277 - 279.

If you want to test Part 2.3 (train the models on half the training set) uncomment lines 174-178, and 219-223

If you want to test Part 2.4 (convert tokens that appear less than 5 times
to UNK, uncomment lines 201 - 207.
